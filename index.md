## About me

This is an unorganized and probably not up to date collection of information about me and private notes such as link collections and project summaries. 

### Social Networking

* [Linked-In Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcel-kost/) short CV
* [Xing Profile](https://www.xing.com/profile/Marcel_Kost2/) same CV, different platform

## Personal Notes

I keep and sometimes extend a [Link Collection](/link_collection) that basically serves as my personal bookmarking service. 

### Private Projects

* [Wanderkastern 2.0](https://hackaday.io/project/27007-wanderkastern-20) a robust weather-proof beer case with illumination (and Wifi)
* [C++ Webserver](https://github.com/tcm-marcel/webserver) I spent one weekend to build a basic webserver for learning purposes
* [NAS](/nas) self-built network storage running FreeNAS (BSD)
